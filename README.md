## Summer Final For VetsInTech

A simple Simon Says game that randomly selects a color, highlights it, and waits for the user to correctly select it in order.
Once the user correctly selects the correct color, or color sequence, the count is increased and the game continues. Currently the game continues until the user makes a mistake. Once a mistake is made the buttons are no longer active and the page must be refreshed.
